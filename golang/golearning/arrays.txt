ARRAYS

store a collection of data of the same type.
 An array is a fixed-length sequence that is used to store homogeneous elements in the memory. Due to their fixed length array are not much popular like Slice in Go language.

You can access the elements of the array by using the index value or by using for loop.
In Go language, the array type is one-dimensional.
The length of the array is fixed and unchangeable.
You are allowed to store duplicate elements in an array.

In an array, if an array does not initialized explicitly, then the default value of this array is 0.

In an array, if ellipsis ‘‘…’’ become visible at the place of length, then the length of the array is determined by the initialized elements.

In an array, you are allowed to iterate over the range of the elements of the array.

In Go language, an array is of value type not of reference type. So when the array is assigned to a new variable, then the changes made in the new variable do not affect the original array.

In an array, if the element type of the array is comparable, then the array type is also comparable. So we can directly compare two arrays using == operator.
